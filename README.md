# Routing Application

The Routing Application is a Java-based solution designed to efficiently manage and query country data. Using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm and graph data structures, this system calculates the shortest delivery routes and cross-border taxes, helping businesses optimize international shipping and logistics.

## Features

- Create and manage global country maps.
- Query detailed country-related information.
- Find the shortest delivery path between two countries using the BFS algorithm.
- Handle exceptions and errors related to country data.
- Simple command-line interface for user interaction.

## Installation

To get started with the Routing Risk Map, make sure you have **Java** installed on your machine. 
Follow the steps below to set up and run the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Routing-Risk-Map.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash   
   cd Routing-Risk-Map
   
3. **Compile and Run the application**:
   ```bash  
   .\mvnw.cmd compile exec:java@run

## Usage

Once the application is running, follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the system. The command-line interface allows you to manage countries and find optimal delivery routes using the BFS algorithm.
